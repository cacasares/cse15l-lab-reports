# Week 1 Lab Report
This is the first lab report for CSE 15L that will cover the first lab conducted today, 1/11/23, which involves installing VScode, remotely connecting, and trying certain commands.

1. **Installing VScode**
* My laptop already had VScode downloaded prior because of my CSE 11 class last quarter.
* Below is a screenshot of what the application looks like:

2. **Remotely Connecting**
* Open Vscode, then click 'Terminal' at the top bar, and open a new terminal.
* Use ssh by typing ssh cs15lwi23zz@ieng6.ucsd.edu, where you put your course-specific account instead of the placeholder 'zz'.
* If asked to connect, type 'yes' and enter the password of your CSE15L account. Do not forget to disconnect (Ctrl-D) once you are done.

3. **Trying Some Commands*
* After completing step 2, try some commands such as :
```
* cd ~
* cd
* ls -lat
```
* For example, running the command ls -lat seems to list out the files of the directory I am currently working in. This is what it should look similar to:
